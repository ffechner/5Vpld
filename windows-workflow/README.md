# Overview
The `5vcomp.bat` batch file can be used to automate compiling of `.PLD` files with `CUPL.EXE`.
This eliminates the need to use WinCUPL directly. Use your favorite IDE or text editor.

WinCUPL is nonetheless a requirement as it provides:
* The CUPL.EXE compiler
* The Atmel.dl device library (which CUPL.EXE uses)
* The fitters for the ATF150x CPLD parts (though this utility will refuse to work with the ones provided by Atmel WinCUPL -- please replace them with the newer ones from the Atmel Prochip package)

This script isn't anything too sophisticated. It merely checks for a bunch of common but esoteric gotchas and provides a working example on how to go from a .PLD to a .JED

Basic customizations (compiler flags, device library) are broken out into variables at the top of the script.

The Linux equivalent version of 5vcomp is probably a bit ahead of this and more elaborate, but it is trying to do the same thing in essence.

# Installation

* Install WinCUPL with default options and default installation path.
  * <a href="https://www.microchip.com/en-us/products/fpgas-and-plds/spld-cplds/pld-design-resources">Download WinCUPL from here</a>.
  * Serial Number is `60008009`

* Install Atmel Prochip to the default install path: `C:\ATMEL_PLS_Tools`
  * <a href="https://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/ProChip5.0.1.zip">Download Atmel Prochip from here</a>
  * You only need to select the "ProChip Designer 5.0" option if you do not want the additional software.


Place `5vcomp.bat` inside of `C:\Wincupl\WinCupl\Fitters` and it should end up in your path so you can run it from anywhere.

Adding `context-menu-pld-5vcomp.reg` to the registry will add the "compile" right-click
option to any `.PLD` files, which will simply call `C:\Wincupl\WinCupl\Fitters\5vcomp.bat` [your-cupl-project.PLD]

`5vcomp.bat` will refuse to run until you replace the installed fitters with those from Atmel Prochip
* You can use `5vinstall.bat` to replace these for you, or you can do the following manually:
* Overwrite all three of the FIT150x.EXE fitters in C:\Wincupl\WinCupl\Fitters\ with those that have been installed from Atmel Prochip.
  * The prochip files are inside of C:\ATMEL_PLS_Tools\Prochip\pldfit\
  * Also delete all three of the FIND150x.EXE files in C:\Wincupl\WinCupl\Fitters\ and copy each of the corresponding FIT150x.EXE in their place.
    * FIT1502.EXE is Copied to FIND1502.EXE
    * FIT1504.EXE is Copied to FIND1504.EXE
    * FIT1508.EXE is Copied to FIND1508.EXE
* It's simply not worth using the old fitters -- too many variables of things that can go wrong.

# Usage
Run `5vcomp your-project.PLD`

Alternately, if you have imported `context-menu-pld-5vcomp.reg`, you can simply right-click on your .PLD file and select "Compile PLD"

This should generate a bunch of files and most crucially, a .JED file if everything works properly.

See the [examples folder](../examples) for some simple .PLD files to make sure everything is working properly.

# Notes

This workflow has been tested to run properly on:
 - Windows XP 32-bit
 - Windows 7 64-bit
 - Windows 10 64-bit 22H2

Todo:
* Impose character length limit on filenames (CSIM.EXE issues)
* Probably check to make sure find150x.exe files have been replaced with their corresponding fit150x.exe files. **If you don't do this, the fitter will not be automatically run and you won't get a .JED file for the CPLD parts.**
