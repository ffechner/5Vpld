Files included here are simple examples designed to allow one to get started quickly:

The following example demonstrates a simple buffer between two pins, and is targeted for an Atmel ATF1502 CPLD:<br>
<code>5vcomp buffer.PLD</code>

Running this should generate many files. Refer to "Terminology & File Formats" of the main README.md for a guide to what these are.

`5vtemplate.py` is a simple GUI that will generate a skeleton `.PLD` file.

More elaborate examples are included with WinCUPL. References for the CUPL programming language are invaluable for getting further work done.
