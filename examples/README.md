Files included here are simple examples designed to allow one to get started quickly:

The following example demonstrates a simple buffer between two pins, and is targeted for an Atmel ATF1502 CPLD:<br>
<code>5vcomp buffer.PLD</code>

Running this should generate many files. Refer to "Terminology & File Formats" of the main README.md for a guide to what these are.

`5vtemplate.py` is a simple GUI that will generate a skeleton `.PLD` file which has the necessary headers CUPL is expecting.

See also `C:\Wincupl\Examples\Atmel` for a bunch of more elaborate vendor included examples, demonstrating the language as well as what is possible to build using these devices.

References for the CUPL programming language are invaluable for getting further work done.
